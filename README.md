# Python Exam Project
##### Created by Jens Gelbek, Peter Rambeck, Caroline HÃ¸g, Tobias Zimmermann

## Description
In this project, we focus on cereals; their prices and nutrional content. 
We start by giving the program a picture of some cereal we have at hand and using image recognition from `pytesseract` we obtain the brand and name of the cereal. 

Then we webscrape to get the nutrional content (calories (kcal), proteins (g), carbohydrates (g), fiber (g), fat (g), and salt (g)) of the original cereal. Futhermore, we scrape for alternatives to the original cereal. We scrape from the following websites:
1. https://hjem.foetex.dk/kategori/kolonial/morgenmad-smoerepaalaeg-og-marmelade/morgenmadsprodukter/ 
2. https://mad.coop.dk/irma/alle-varer
3. https://www.nemlig.com/
4. https://shop.rema1000.dk/

Finally, we plot the found data to make it easy to see what the different cereals cost, which are cheapest compared to price per 100 grams, and how many percent of the daily recommended nutrional intake a specific cereal makes up.
